            <li>Time: 57 minutes</li>
            <li>Serves: 8 people</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ol>
            
            <li>1 large red bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped
            <li>1 large, ripe tomato, cored and quartered
            <li>1 whole habanero pepper, stem removed


            <li>1 whole Fresno chili, or jalapeño, stem removed


            <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled


            <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled


            <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled


            <li>1/3 cup olive oil


            <li>1 red onion, diced


            <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste


            <li>1/4 cup tomato paste


            <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika


            <li>1 teaspoon curry powder


            <li>1 teaspoon cumin


            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme


            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper


            <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric


            <li>2 1/4 cups basmati rice


            <li>1 bay leaf


            <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon paste


            <li>1/4 cup chopped green onion for garnish (optional)


            <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro, for garnish (optional)



        </ol>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set aside.</p>
        <p><strong>Step: 2</strong>  Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.

</p>
        <p><strong>Step: 3</strong> Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.

 </p>
        <p><strong>Step: 4</strong>  Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.

</p>
        <p><strong>Step: 5</strong>  Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.

</p>
        <p><strong>Step: 6</strong>  After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork, separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro.

</p>
         
  <h5> If rice seems to be a little undercooked at this point, stop fluffing. Pat the rice down gently with the back of the fork, cover tightly again, and set heat to medium low. Cook for another 5 minutes, and check again. <br>

        <ul>
            <li>Time: 2 hours 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Serves: 6 fatasses</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ol>
            <li>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak


            <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil


            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced


            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley


            <li>¼ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary


            <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh chives


            <li>¼ cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)


            <li>½ teaspoon salt


            <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper


            <li>¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder


        
            
            
        </ol>
       
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.


</p>
       <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.


</p>

      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.


</p>


       <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.
