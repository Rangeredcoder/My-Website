                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>My journey began in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bougouni,+Mali/@11.421557,-7.4841823,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0xe4d99cc4b4c39af:0x48c503330f3e8661!8m2!3d11.4182881!4d-7.4705935!16zL20vMDZxMXZj?entry=ttu"  class="link">Bougouni, Mali</a> on June 2, 2012 where I was taught alot of things. One of the most important things I learned in Bougouni was my language. Untill I was 5 years old I lived in Bougouni with my family while my dad was in america since 2011. Then I came to America with my brother in 2018. At that time I was new to America I couldn't speak english and I had to repeat a grade. But over the next few months I would get progressively better at english and would become fluent at english. By that time I was in first grade and it was time for my family to get a bigger house bcause my mom and my sister would also be coming to America. We got an apartment in a residential neighborhood called <a href="https://www.parkchesternyc.com/" class="link">parckester</a>. Once i moved into parckester with my family i started school at <a href="https://www.ps106x.net/"  class="link">Ps106x</a> or Parckester School 106x as a second grader. During that time i was in school and at home i would also be studying using <a href="https://www.ixl.com/recommendations"  class="link">IXL</a></p>
