    <h1> What to do in tokyo!</h1>

    <h2>Senso-ji</h2>
    <p>Tokyo may not have as many temples as Kyoto, but Senso-ji isn’t the capital city’s most popular just by default. The atmosphere alone here is one for the bucket list. Senso-ji, the temple itself, is at the end of the shopping street, while a recently renovated five-story pagoda stands to the left (ranking in as the second tallest pagoda in Japan). Japanese visitors flutter around a large cauldron in front of the temple where incense burned inside is said to benefit good health. Travelers keen to avoid crowds should arrive early, but even tourists that are remotely interested in Japanese culture will find something to appreciate here.</p>

    <h2> Aqua Park Shinagawa</h2>
    <p> Maxell Aqua Park Shinagawa is an aquarium located around two minutes' walk from Shinagawa Station. Here, the marine world is decorated in unique ways, with displays of synchronized light and sound, and a large jellyfish tank called "Jellyfish Ramble." There's an area full of rides, including a merry-go-round where you can ride aquatic animals. It even has the Coral Cafe Bar, featuring illuminated tanks of coral, and more.</p>

       <h2> Tokyo SkyTree</h2> 
    <p> Topping off at 2,080 feet, the Tokyo Skytree is the tallest tower (that's tower, not building) in the world. From the broadcast tower’s 360-degree observation decks, the whole city—its striking skyscrapers and neon intersections—looks like a magical circuit board. It’s a major tourist attraction and a ticket isn’t cheap (up to ¥3,400, or $25, for combo tickets), but even if you don’t pay to go inside, there’s no denying that the Tokyo Skytree brought the skyline to a whole new level. Depending on where you’re staying, it can be an out-of-the-way trip to eastern Tokyo (luckily, a train station gets you right near the entrance). Families with children will enjoy the experience—especially the speedy elevator rides—as will anyone that loves a jaw-dropping view.</P>

    <h2>Shinjuku Goyen National Garden</h2>
    <p> Fancy a stroll in a Japanese garden? Get that and more at Shinjuku Gyoen. In addition to native, traditional gardens, the 144-acre park pockets French Formal and English Landscape gardens, all of which are worth the modest entrance fee. Landmarks are stunning and impossible to forget, like a Taiwan Pavilion perched along a serene pond. Formerly an imperial garden, it became a national garden after World War II—so you can trust that this precious plot is always beautifully maintained. Don’t miss cherry blossom season.</p>
        
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Kawasaki_Nihon_Minkaen-3.jpg" width="364">    
        <h2>Kawasaki Nihon Minkaen</h2>
        <p>Though only 20 minutes by train from central Tokyo, the Nihon Minka-En Japan Open-Air Folk House Museum, located in a suburb of neighboring Kawasaki City, feels a world—and several centuries—away. The sprawling grounds are home to 25 marvelously preserved Edo-era homes relocated from all over the Japanese countryside, spanning an array of styles from farmhouses to samurai houses and includes a shrine, water mill and kabuki stage. Don’t miss the traditional indigo dyeing workshop in the middle of the park houses a small shop where you can find indigo-dyed everything, from socks and sweaters to handkerchiefs and masks.
